#' Inventory of USGS shallow aquifer data near park units
#' 
#' This function imports shallow aquifer features within and nearby park unit boundaries
#' 
#' @param park The 4-digit unit code(s) for national parks of interest. Must be in ALL CAPS.
#' @param dist The distance (in the same units used by `getParkBoundary()`) to buffer around park boundary
#' @return An sf object of shallow aquifers within and nearby (dist=dist) park unit boundaries
