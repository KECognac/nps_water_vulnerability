# nps_water_vulnerability
This project will evaluate the influence of climate change on the security of NPS water supplies, beginning with parks in hydrologic settings most likely to experience supply challenges. If a water supply is found to be sensitive to climate change and projected to experience climate-related changes that will impair the supply's quantity and/or quality, adapatation actions can be undertaken to further secure that water supply (e.g., increase water conservation at the site, reduce existing losses in water transmission, increase water storage, etc.)
