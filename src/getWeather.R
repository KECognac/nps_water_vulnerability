#' Pull weather station data for parks
#' 
#' This function imports weather station data from NOAA, SNOTEL and PRISM databases
#' 
#' @param aoi An sf polygon object, often a park boundary (or boundaries) retrieved from `getParkBoundary()`.
#' @param dist The distance (in the same units used by `getParkBoundary()`) to buffer around park boundary
#' @param save Whether to save the resulting file (TRUE/FALSE)
#' @param path If `save == TRUE`, the file path to save to
#' @return An sf object of weather stations within given spatial boundary and attributes
