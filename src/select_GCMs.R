#' Function to select GCMs
#' 
#' This function follows Amber Runyon's code and Lawrence et al. 2021 to select GCMs for a given park
#' 
#' @param park Four digit park code
#' @param region Park region to use for selecting low skill models. 3 letter code (capitatlized)
#' @param future_years Range of future years to summarize means for. Two years separated by ":"
#' @param historic_years Range of historic years to summarize means for. Two years separated by ":"
#' @param low_skill_cutoff A percentage (in decimal form) for removing low skill models
#' @param method  The method to use for GCM selection; either 'corners' or 'pca'
#' @param path  The path to the desired data/ folder
#'
#' @return A dataframe with the selected GCMs and assigned climate futures for all centroids within park
